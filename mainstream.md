My journey in High Energy Physics (HEP) is represented in the following figure. I found Right-Handed Neutrinos could connect flavor physics to cosmology. In more detail existing of these sterile neutrinos can govern both leptogenesis as a successful baryogenesis scenario and the Non-Standard Interaction of neutrinos.

Now, I want to complete my journey in HEP by transitioning to Hadron Physics.
The potential connection of Flavor Physics and Cosmology to it could be Deep Inelastic Scattering/Beauty meson decay and Quark-Gluon Plasma/Dark Matter searches respectively. 

Also, I want to understand HEP once again but in an experimental way instead of a phenomenological which I have a background in.
