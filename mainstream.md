My journey in High Energy Physics is represented in the following figure.

I found Right-Handed Neutrinos (sterile neutrinos) as a connection between flavor physics and cosmology. In more detail, existing of these new particles can govern both leptogenesis as a successful baryogenesis scenario and the Non-Standard Interaction of neutrinos. 
I delved into baryogenesis via leptogenesis in non-standard cosmologies during my master's.
Then, as I wanted to complete my journey in HEP I used neutrino NSI as a portal to interact with hadrons.
Now, I started my work on the measurement of the antiproton production cross section which mainly contains hadron physics. However, our main motivation is the indirect search for Dark Matter via comparison of antiproton production in cosmic rays. So, it will help me to close my journey loop by connecting hadron physics to cosmology.

In addition, I would like to split HEP study techniques according to the following figure.

I have started to transition from the phenomenological to the data analyzing approach (which is called the experimental approach when it combines by R&D of detectors) to capture a wide picture from HEP.
