Advancements in precise neutrino experiments offer promising opportunities to explore new physics by examining the effects of Neutral Current Non-Standard Interactions between neutrinos and matter. While neutrino oscillation experiments have already imposed stringent limits on all vector NC NSI flavor elements, axial NC NSI remains elusive in these studies. However, neutrino-nucleon scattering presents a unique avenue to investigate axial NC NSI. This discussion focuses on the influence of NC NSI on neutrino-nucleon scattering.
